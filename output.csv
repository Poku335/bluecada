Clinical interpretation: 
1.     Increasing copy number of EGFR gene in non-small cell carcinoma was associated with increased OS and PFS, supporting the idea that EGFR gene copy number is a biomarker for response to EGFR-TKI therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC.
Dahabreh et al., 2011, Ann. Oncol.
Zhang et al., 2017, J. Investig. Med.

2. Increasing copy number of FGFR1 gene in non-small cell carcinoma is common in squamous cell carcinoma. There are early clinical trials and pre-clinical study of FGFR inhibitors in squamous cell carcinoma/lung cancer cell line with FGFR1 amplification.
Nogova et al., 2017, J. Clin. Oncol.
Perera et al., 2017, Mol. Cancer Ther.

3. Increasing copy number of RICTOR gene in pulmonary adenocarcinoma may have benefited from treatments with dual mTOR1/2 inhibitors (case study).

Somatic variant classification/Clinical evidence categories (AMP/ASCO/CAP recommendation)
Tier 1: Variant of strong clinical significant (Pathogenic)
Clinical evidence level A (1A): FDA-approved therapy included in professional guidelines (such as ESMO, NCCN, etc.)
Clinical evidence level B (1B): Well-powered studies with consensus from experts in the field
Tier 2: Variant of potential clinical significant (Likely pathogenic)
Clinical evidence level C (2C):
1. Biomarkers that predict response or resistance to therapies approved by the FDA or professional societies for a different type of tumor
2. Biomarkers that serve as inclusion criteria for clinical trials
Clinical evidence level D (2D): Biomarkers that show plausible therapeutic significance based on preclinical studies
Tier 3: Variant of unknown clinical significant (VUS)
Not observed at a significant allele frequency in the general or specific subpopulation databases, or pan-cancer or tumor-specific variant databases
No convincing published evidence of cancer association
Tier 4: Benign or likely benign variant
Observed at significant allele frequency in the general or specific subpopulation databases
No existing published evidence of cancer association
**************************************************************************
Method:
         The histologic evaluation was performed by certified-pathologist for tumor enrichment process.
         The QIAact Lung DNA UMI panel is the target enrichment method, library preparation and sequencing steps all utilize DNA polymerase and amplification processes. 
         Genomic DNA samples are first fragmented, end-repaired and A-tailed using a single, controlled multi-enzyme reaction. The prepared DNA fragments are then ligated at their 5' ends to a GeneReader specific adapter containing an UMI and a 9 base-pair (bp) sample-specific bar code.
         Ligated DNA molecules are subject to limited cycles of target enrichment PCR, with one gene-specific primer targeting a region and one universal forward primer complimentary to an adapter sequence. This reaction ensures that intended targets and UMIs are enriched sufficiently to be represented in the final library. A universal PCR with GeneReader specific sequences is then carried out to amplify the targets and complete the library. 
         
Bioinformatics pipeline:
         All detected variants can be further interpreted by QIAGEN Clinical Insight (QCI), which is using QIAGEN's comprehensive Knowledgebase of literature curated content to allow a standardized variant classification and reporting. BAM file and VCF file are reviewing in integrative genomics view version 2.9.4 based on human genome GRCh37 (hg 19) reference sequence genes nomenclature.
        Additional database references:
Population database: ESP, dbSNP, 1000Genome, ExAC
Somatic database: COSMIC, My Cancer Genome, TCGA, OncoKB.org
Germline database: HGMD, ClinVar
         
Panel gene coverage: GeneRead QIAct Lung panels UMI (DNA) panel could be detected 550 variants across 19 genes (AKT1, ALK, BRAF, DDR2, EGFR, ERBB2/HER2, ESR1, FGFR1, KIT, KRAS, MAP2K1, MET, NOTCH1, NRAS, NTRK1, PDGFRA, PIK3CA, PTEN, RICTOR, ROS1) including SNVs, InDels, and CNVs.

Limit of detection: 
1. Limitation for amplicon-based NGS for detection of gene alteration such as fixation artefacts/PCR duplicates, large deletions/rearrangements, low coverage uniformity, and mutations at amplicon ends may have occurred.
2. This test is amplicon-based DNA sequencing and highly coverage only coding exonic regions of the genes in the panel list. The intronic events such as splice site or fusion alterations may not detect.
3. Very low allele mutant frequency or poor quality of nucleic acid due to various factors may cause false negative/positive or call variant error or invalid result. Orthogonal methods such as Sanger sequencing for confirmation is recommended. 
4. Wild-type or negative result does not totally exclude the absence of a gene alteration that may cause from limit of detection.
5.  Rare polymorphism may be present and cause false results.
6. Germline and somatic mutation of the gene could not be distinguished in this current method.
7. Variants of unknown significance may be changed to pathogenic or benign variants in the future due to more strong evidence of those variants.
Note: This Lung DNA panel may not detect fusion or complex gene rearrangement or complete copy number alteration (CNAs) in specific genes. For complex genetic rearrangement or fusion with know/unknown partners; RNA-based NGS is recommended.

Clinical implication: According to CAP/IASLC/AMP guideline (1),  testing for EGFR mutations in non-small cell lung carcinoma (primary lung adenocarcinoma) may help guide patient selection for administers tyrosine kinase inhibitors (such as erlotinib or gefitinib or afatinib) as the prevalence of positivity for EGFR mutation in Asian/Pacific patients reaches to 45%(2). Some patterns of EGFR mutations (especially EGFR Exon20 T790M (p.Thr790Met)) may cause the resistance to first or second line TKI inhibitors but third-line TKIs (such as osimertinib) may have benefit.

ALK immunohistochemistry study report:
Immunohistochemistry clone: Anti-ALK (D5F3)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Result: 
                       Negative for ALK expression
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment:  Immunohistochemistry for ALK protein expression (VENTENA ALK D5F3) has been approved by US-FDA for companion diagnostic (CDx) assay to identify ALK-positive NSCLC with crizotinib and ceritinib. FISH or RT-PCR or NGS technique is the confirmation test.
Clinical implication:  About 5% of NSCLC (especially adenocarcinoma) harbor the fusion ALK gene. The previously clinical trial study demonstrated that NSCLC with ALK gene rearrangement may have partial response rate with crizotinib therapy and it has already been approved by US-FDA in 2011. According to the recommendation of CAP/IASLC/AMP (1), the recommended procedure for ALK  gene rearrangement is fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay using dual-labeled break-apart probe. Many studies(2), (3), (4), (5)showed high sensitivity and specificity (especially clone D5F3) between anti-ALK protein immunostain and FISH for ALK gene rearrangement.
Technical note: The VENTENA anti-ALK (D5F3) is used for a detection of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) protein in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) of non-small cell lung cancer tissue and stained on a VENTENA BenchMark XT immunohistochemical automated slide stainer.

ADDENDUM (11/10/2564):
Immunohistochemical stains result:
          -  The spindle cells stain positive with CD34; equivocal result with beta-catenin; but negative with desmin, SMA, EMA and S100 protein.
          -   The positive result of CD34 favors dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. However, the equivocal result of beta-catenin raises the differential diagnosis of fibromatosis (see COMMENT).
COMMENT: Limitation for definite diagnosis by small size of the specimen received. Excision with further pathology examination of the lesion is suggested.

Clinical implication: According to CAP/IASLC/AMP guideline (1),  testing for EGFR mutations in non-small cell lung carcinoma (primary lung adenocarcinoma) may help guide patient selection for administers tyrosine kinase inhibitors (such as erlotinib or gefitinib or afatinib) as the prevalence of positivity for EGFR mutation in Asian/Pacific patients reaches to 45%(2). Some patterns of EGFR mutations (especially EGFR Exon20 T790M (p.Thr790Met)) may cause the resistance to first or second line TKI inhibitors but third-line TKIs (such as osimertinib) may have benefit.

ALK immunohistochemistry study report:
Immunohistochemistry clone: Anti-ALK (D5F3)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Result: 
                       Negative for ALK protein expression
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment:  Immunohistochemistry for ALK protein expression (VENTENA ALK D5F3) has been approved by US-FDA for companion diagnostic (CDx) assay to identify ALK-positive NSCLC with crizotinib and ceritinib. FISH or RT-PCR or NGS technique is the confirmation test.
Clinical implication:  About 5% of NSCLC (especially adenocarcinoma) harbor the fusion ALK gene. The previously clinical trial study demonstrated that NSCLC with ALK gene rearrangement may have partial response rate with crizotinib therapy and it has already been approved by US-FDA in 2011. According to the recommendation of CAP/IASLC/AMP (1), the recommended procedure for ALK  gene rearrangement is fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay using dual-labeled break-apart probe. Many studies(2), (3), (4), (5)showed high sensitivity and specificity (especially clone D5F3) between anti-ALK protein immunostain and FISH for ALK gene rearrangement.
Technical note: The VENTENA anti-ALK (D5F3) is used for a detection of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) protein in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) of non-small cell lung cancer tissue and stained on a VENTENA BenchMark XT immunohistochemical automated slide stainer.

   - Comment: The cancer in this sample has a low level (1%-10%) of ER expression by IHC. There are limited data on the overall benefit of endocrine therapies for patients with low level (1%-10%) ER expression, but they currently suggest possible benefit, so patients are considered eligible for endocrine treatment. There are data that suggest invasive cancers with these results are heterogeneous in both behavior and biology and often have gene expression profiles more similar to ER-negative cancers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clinical implication: According to CAP/IASLC/AMP guideline (1),  testing for EGFR mutations in non-small cell lung carcinoma (primary lung adenocarcinoma) may help guide patient selection for administers tyrosine kinase inhibitors (such as erlotinib or gefitinib or afatinib) as the prevalence of positivity for EGFR mutation in Asian/Pacific patients reaches to 45%(2). Some patterns of EGFR mutations (especially EGFR Exon20 T790M (p.Thr790Met)) may cause the resistance to first or second line TKI inhibitors but third-line TKIs (such as osimertinib) may have benefit.
Comment: The COBAS EGFR mutation v.2 (US-FDA approval, CE-IVD) test using allele-specific PCR method is designed for formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue (FFPET) or plasma** sample. It can be identifies 42 mutations in exon 18 G719X (c.2156G>c, c.2155G>A, c.2155 G>T), exon 19 deletions (c.2240_2251del12, c.2239_2247del9, c.2238_2255del18, c.2235_2249del15, c.2236_2250del15, c.2239_2253del15, c.2239_2256del18, c.2237_2254del18, c.2240_2254del15, c.2240_2257del18, c.2239_2248TTAAGAGAAG>C, c.2239_2251>C,c.2237_225>T, c.2235_2255>AAT, c.2237_2252>T, c.2239_2258>CA, c.2239_2256>CAA, c.2237_2253>TTGCT, c.2238_2252>GCA, c.2238_2248>GC, c.2237_2251del15, c.2236_2253del18, c.2235_2248>AATTC, c.2235_2252>AAT, c.2235_2251>AATTC, c.2253_2276del24, c.2237_2257>TCT, c.2238_2252del15 and c.2233_2247del15), exon 20 T790M (c.2369C>T), exon 20 S768I (c.2303G>T), exon 20 insertions (c.2307_2308ins9GCCAGCGTG, c.2319_2320insCAC, c.2310_2311insGGT, c.2311_2312ins9GCGTGGACA, c.2309_2301AC>CCAGCGTGGAT)), exon 21 L858R (c.2573T>G, c.2573_2574TG>GT), and Exon 21 L861Q (c.2582T>A) of the EGFR gene.

Clinical implication: According to CAP/IASLC/AMP guideline (1),  testing for EGFR mutations in non-small cell lung carcinoma (primary lung adenocarcinoma) may help guide patient selection for administers tyrosine kinase inhibitors (such as erlotinib or gefitinib or afatinib) as the prevalence of positivity for EGFR mutation in Asian/Pacific patients reaches to 45%(2). Some patterns of EGFR mutations (especially EGFR Exon20 T790M (p.Thr790Met)) may cause the resistance to first or second line TKI inhibitors but third-line TKIs (such as osimertinib) may have benefit.

ALK immunohistochemistry study report:
Immunohistochemistry clone: Anti-ALK (D5F3)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Result: 
                       Negative for ALK protein expression
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment:  Immunohistochemistry for ALK protein expression (VENTENA ALK D5F3) has been approved by US-FDA for companion diagnostic (CDx) assay to identify ALK-positive NSCLC with crizotinib and ceritinib. FISH or RT-PCR or NGS technique is the confirmation test.
Clinical implication:  About 5% of NSCLC (especially adenocarcinoma) harbor the fusion ALK gene. The previously clinical trial study demonstrated that NSCLC with ALK gene rearrangement may have partial response rate with crizotinib therapy and it has already been approved by US-FDA in 2011. According to the recommendation of CAP/IASLC/AMP (1), the recommended procedure for ALK  gene rearrangement is fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay using dual-labeled break-apart probe. Many studies(2), (3), (4), (5)showed high sensitivity and specificity (especially clone D5F3) between anti-ALK protein immunostain and FISH for ALK gene rearrangement.
Technical note: The VENTENA anti-ALK (D5F3) is used for a detection of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) protein in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) of non-small cell lung cancer tissue and stained on a VENTENA BenchMark XT immunohistochemical automated slide stainer.

Immunohistochemistry study for BRAF 
Specimen type: FFPE

Neoplastic content: 10-20%

Result:
************************************************************
*** POSITIVE , Cytoplasmic stain Score 2+ to 3+***
************************************************************
Clinical consideration for pediatric Langerhans cell histiocytosis: 
       BRAF p.V600E mutations are detected in greater than 50% of pediatric Langerhans cell
histiocytosis (LCH) lesions. However, the use of mutation?specific BRAF V600E immunohistochemistry as a surrogate for molecular testing in pediatric LCH is unknown. 
       Some studies of pediatric LCH show low concordant rate between positive BRAF by IHC and molecular test (PCR/Sequencing) for BRAF V600E point mutation at exon 15.
Comment:
 Immunohistochemistry for BRAF clone VE1 is high specificity and sensitivity only point mutation of BRAF V600E in exon 15. Other non-BRAFV600 variants or very low level mutant allele frequency could not be detected by this method. Currently, immunohistochemistry for BRAF clone VE1 is just a screening test and *** NOT APPROVED *** for therapeutic biomarker in specific therapy selection. Molecular test for BRAF gene analysis is recommended for definite genotype.

Clinical implication: According to CAP/IASLC/AMP guideline (1),  testing for EGFR mutations in non-small cell lung carcinoma (primary lung adenocarcinoma) may help guide patient selection for administers tyrosine kinase inhibitors (such as erlotinib or gefitinib or afatinib) as the prevalence of positivity for EGFR mutation in Asian/Pacific patients reaches to 45%(2). Some patterns of EGFR mutations (especially EGFR Exon20 T790M (p.Thr790Met)) may cause the resistance to first or second line TKI inhibitors but third-line TKIs (such as osimertinib) may have benefit.

ALK immunohistochemistry study report:
Immunohistochemistry clone: Anti-ALK (D5F3)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Result: 
                       Negative for ALK protein expression
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comment:  Immunohistochemistry for ALK protein expression (VENTENA ALK D5F3) has been approved by US-FDA for companion diagnostic (CDx) assay to identify ALK-positive NSCLC with crizotinib and ceritinib. FISH or RT-PCR or NGS technique is the confirmation test.
Clinical implication:  About 5% of NSCLC (especially adenocarcinoma) harbor the fusion ALK gene. The previously clinical trial study demonstrated that NSCLC with ALK gene rearrangement may have partial response rate with crizotinib therapy and it has already been approved by US-FDA in 2011. According to the recommendation of CAP/IASLC/AMP (1), the recommended procedure for ALK  gene rearrangement is fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay using dual-labeled break-apart probe. Many studies(2), (3), (4), (5)showed high sensitivity and specificity (especially clone D5F3) between anti-ALK protein immunostain and FISH for ALK gene rearrangement.
Technical note: The VENTENA anti-ALK (D5F3) is used for a detection of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) protein in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) of non-small cell lung cancer tissue and stained on a VENTENA BenchMark XT immunohistochemical automated slide stainer.
